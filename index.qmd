## Abstract

This hands-on workshop demonstrates practical strategies for accelerating computational workflows in empirical research. Participants will learn a systematic approach to performance optimization, beginning with a naive R implementation and progressively applying multiple acceleration techniques.
The session covers: (1) native R optimization strategies, (2) integrating C++ via Rcpp, (3) leveraging Julia for high-performance computing, (4) implementing parallelization within R, (5) utilizing GPU acceleration with torch, and (6) scaling to cluster computing for horizontal parallelism. Each approach includes implementation, testing, error handling, and benchmarking to quantify performance gains. The workshop also demonstrates how AI-assisted coding tools can facilitate cross-language development and code optimization.
Attendees will leave with a practical framework for identifying performance bottlenecks and selecting appropriate optimization strategies for their computational research needs.
