The R package used to illustrate the advantages using compiled C++ code when parallelizing computations is available [here](apopt_0.1.0.tar.gz).

You can install it directly from the tarball using the following command in R:

```{r}
install.packages("apopt_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Once installed, you can load the package and use the functions implemented in C++ as follows:

```{r}
library(apopt)
# Example usage of the C++ implemented function
american_put_value <- ap_v3_rcpp(
  S0 = 100,
  K = 100,
  r = 0.05,
  q = 0.02,
  tt = 1,
  sigma = 0.2,
  steps = 1000
)

print(american_put_value)
```
