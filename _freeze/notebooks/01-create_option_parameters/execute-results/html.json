The asset price ($S_0$) follows a uniform distribution between 70 and 130. The dividend rate ($q$) is uniform between 0.0 and 0.1. The riskless interest rate ($r$) is uniform between 0.0 and 0.1, with probability 0.8, and with probability 0.2 equal to 0.0. Because only the ratio between asset price and exercise price ($K$) is of interest, since relative errors do not change if $S$ and $K$ are scaled by the same factor, the exercise price is fixed to 100.0.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(42)\nn <- 2500\n\noption_parameters <- tibble(\n  option_set = 1:n,\n  volatility = runif(n, 0.1, 0.6),\n  time_to_maturity = ifelse(\n    runif(n) < 0.75,\n    runif(n, 0.1, 1.0),\n    runif(n, 1.0, 5.0)\n  ),\n  asset_price = runif(n, 70, 130),\n  dividend_rate = runif(n, 0.0, 0.1),\n  riskless_rate = ifelse(runif(n) < 0.8, runif(n, 0.0, 0.1), 0.0),\n  exercise_price = rep(100.0, n)\n)\n\nsaveRDS(option_parameters, here(\"data\", \"processed\", \"option_parameters.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
